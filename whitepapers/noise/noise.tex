\section{Overview}
This document describes the strategies the library uses for generation of randomness and noise.
I believe there will need to be ongoing discussions about how best to perform randomized computations
in the library, as properly doing so is more complicated in practice than in theory.

% TODO: talk about exact rounding as post-processing of true DP

% TODO: note high variance in timing of mpfr (https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mandrysc/pub/subnormal.pdf)

% TODO: note that "precision" in mpfr is number of bits used in the mantissa (including the implicit leading 1)
%       and that calculations are run to ensure exact rounding regardless of the precision of the input/output

\section{Source of Randomness}
% TODO: make notes here on different models of noise generation?
All of our random number generation involves uniform random sampling of bits via OpenSSL.
We will take as given that OpenSSL is cryptographically secure. We intend to support a broader set 
of cryptographically secure sources of randomness at a later date.

\section{Preliminaries}
\begin{definition}
	\label{defn:differential_privacy}
	Differential Privacy \cite{DMNS06} \newline
	For $\epsilon, \delta \geq 0$, a randomized mechanism
	$\mathcal{M}: \mathcal{X}^n \times \mathcal{Q} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ is
	$(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP if, for every pair of neighboring data sets $X, X' \in \mathcal{X}^n$ and
	every query $q \in \mathcal{Q}$ we have
	\[ \forall \mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{Y}: \Pr[\mathcal{M}(X, \epsilon, \delta, q) \in \mathcal{T}] \leq e^{\epsilon} \Pr[\mathcal{M}(X', \epsilon, \delta, q) \in \mathcal{T}] + \delta. \]
\end{definition}
If $\delta = 0$, we call this \emph{Pure DP}. If $\delta > 0$, we call this \emph{Approximate DP}.
Note that, in practice, differential privacy could be thought of a bit more broadly -- as a bounded
distance between joint distributions over the mechanism output and runtime.\footnote{Conceivably, this idea
could be extended further to talk about distributions over all quantities related in any way to the underlying data.
For example, imagine that the US government uses $\epsilon = 1$ if the President is in the data and $\epsilon = 10$
if not -- if anyone knew about this rule, the choice of epsilon would leak information not accounted for in the
traditional definition of DP.
We will focus only on mechanism output and runtime, as they seem to be by far the most plausible
channels of information leakage.} We will focus mostly on the distribution over mechanism output, as this
is really the core idea of DP, but will touch on runtime when it seems appropriate.

\begin{definition}
	\label{defn:exact_rounding}
	Exact Rounding \newline
	Let $S \subset \R$ be some set.
	Let $\phi: \R^n \rightarrow \R$ be a function on the reals and $\phi': S^n \rightarrow S$ be its implementation over $S$.
	Then, $\phi'$ respects \emph{exact rounding} for $(\phi, S)$ if
	\[ \forall s \in S: \phi'(s) = round_{S}[\phi(s)], \]
	where $round_{S}(\cdot)$ rounds a real number to a member of $S$ according to some rounding rule.
\end{definition}
For our purposes, we will care only about the case where $S = \F$, the set of IEEE-754 floating-point numbers.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:truncation_censoring}
	Truncation and Censoring \newline
	Throughout our noise functions, we use the terms ``truncated'' and ``censored''.
	Both are means of bounding the support of the noise distribution, but they are distinct. \newline

	Truncating a distribution simply ignores events outside of the given bounds, so
	all probabilities within the given bounds are scaled up by a constant factor.
	One way to generate a truncated distribution is via rejection sampling.
	You can generate samples from a probability distribution as you normally would (without any bounding),
	and reject any sample that falls outside of your bounds. \newline

	Censoring a distribution, rather than ignoring events outside of the given bounds, pushes the
	probabilities of said events to the closest event within the given bounds. One way to generate
	a censored distribution would be to generate samples from a probability distribution as you
	typically would, and then clamp samples that fall outside of your bounds to the closest element
	inside your bounds.
\end{definition}

\section{Current Random Number Generation}
We have a set of fairly standard procedures for generating draws from various noise distributions.

\subsection{Introduction to MPFR}
The \href{https://www.mpfr.org/}{GNU MPFR Library}\cite{FHL+07} is a C library with methods for carrying out a number
of floating-point operations with \emph{exact rounding}.
MPFR has methods for, among other things, performing basic arithmetic operations and generating samples
from basic noise distributions. \newline 

\subsection{Biased Bit Sampling}
Recall that we are taking as given that we are able to sample uniform bits from OpenSSL.
For many applications, however, we want to be able to sample bits non-uniformly,
i.e. where $\Pr(bit = 1) \neq \frac{1}{2}$. To do so, we use the $sample\_bit$ function.

\subsubsection{$sample\_bit(prob: f64)$}
This function uses the unbiased bit generation from OpenSSL to return a single bit, where $\Pr(bit = 1) = prob$ --
there is a nice write-up of the algorithm \href{https://amakelov.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/arbitrarily-biasing-a-coin-in-2-expected-tosses/}{here}.
We will give a general form of the algorithm, and then talk about implementation details.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{Biasing an unbiased coin}
	\label{alg:biasing_a_coin}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\State $p \gets \Pr(bit = 1)$
		\State Find the infinite binary expansion of $p$, which we call $b = (b_1, b_2, \hdots,)_2$.
		Note that $p = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_i}{2^i}$.
		\State Toss an unbiased coin until the first instance of ``heads''. Call the (1-based) index where this occurred $k$.
		\State return $b_k$
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Let's first show that this procedure gives the correct expectation:
\begin{align*}
	p &= \Pr(bit = 1) \\
		 &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \Pr(bit = 1 \vert k = i) \Pr(k = i) \\
		 &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} b_i \cdot \frac{1}{2^i} \\
		 &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_i}{2^i}.
\end{align*}
This is consistent with the statement in Algorithm~\ref{alg:biasing_a_coin}, so we know that
the process returns bits with the correct bias.
In terms of efficiency, we know that we can stop coin flipping once we get a heads,
so that part of the algorithm has $\E(\# flips) = 2$. \newline

The part that is a bit more difficult is constructing the infinite binary expansion of $p$.
We start by noting that, for our purposes, we do not actually need an infinite binary expansion.
Because $p$ will always be a 64-bit floating-point number, we need only get a binary
expansion that covers all representable numbers in our floating-point standard that are
also valid probabilities.
Luckily, the underlying structure of floating-point numbers makes this quite easy. \newline

In the 64-bit standard, floating-point numbers are represented as
\[ (-1)^s(1.m_1m_2 \hdots m_{52})_2 * 2^{(e_{1}e_2 \hdots e_{11})_2 - 1023}, \]
where $s$ is a sign bit we ignore for our purposes.
Our binary expansion is just the mantissa $(1.m_1m_2 \hdots m_{52})_2$, with
the radix point shifted based on the value of the exponent.
We can then index into the properly shifted mantissa and check the value of the $k$th element.

This method was proposed in \cite{Mir12} as a component of a larger attempt to create
a version of the Laplace mechanism that is not susceptible to floating-point attacks.\footnote{Note that the
original method generates values $\in [0,1)$ rather than arbitrary $[min, max)$.}
There is no universally agreed upon method for generating uniform random numbers (for privacy
applications or otherwise), but this method seems to approximate the real numbers better than many
others because of the sampling relative to the ULP. \newline

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = {green}, title = {Known Privacy Issues}, colbacktitle = black]
	When $i=1023$ we are sampling from subnormal floating-point numbers. Because processors do not typically support
	subnormals natively, they take much longer to sample and open us up to an easier timing attack, as
	seen in \cite{AKM+15}. \newline 

	We are incurring some floating-point error when converting from $[0,1)$ to $[min, max)$ which
	could jeopardize privacy guarantees in ways that are difficult to reason about.\cite{Mir12} \cite{Ilv19}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Sampling from Uniform[min, max]}
In this method, we start by generating a floating-point number in $[0,1)$,
where each is generated with probability relative to its unit of least precision (ULP).\footnote{The ULP is the value
represented by the least significant bit of the mantissa if that bit is a 1.}
That is, we generate $x \in [2^{-i}, 2^{-i+1})$ with probability $\frac{1}{2^i}$
for all $i \in \{1,2,\hdots,1022\}$ and $x \in [0, 2^{-1022})$ for $i = 1023$.
At the end, we will scale our output from $[0,1)$ to be instead in $[min, max)$. Then our function outputs $u$, where
\[ u = (1.m_1m_2 \hdots m_{52})_2 * 2^{-e} * (max - min) + min. \]

This method was proposed in \cite{Mir12} as a component of a larger attempt to create
a version of the Laplace mechanism that is not susceptible to floating-point attacks.\footnote{Note that the
original method generates values $\in [0,1)$ rather than arbitrary $[min, max)$.}
There is no universally agreed upon method for generating uniform random numbers (for privacy
applications or otherwise), but this method seems to approximate the real numbers better than many
others because of the sampling relative to the ULP. \newline

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = {green}, title = {Known Privacy Issues}, colbacktitle = black]
	When $i=1023$ we are sampling from subnormal floating-point numbers. Because processors do not typically support
	subnormals natively, they take much longer to sample and open us up to an easier timing attack, as

	could jeopardize privacy guarantees in ways that are difficult to reason about.\cite{Mir12} \cite{Ilv19}
\end{tcolorbox}

We do have a method for generating uniform samples via MPFR that respects exact rounding, but it is being used in only a few places in the library.

\subsection{Other Continuous Distributions}
In general, we can generate draws from non-uniform continuous distributions (e.g. Laplace, Gaussian)
by using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling}{inverse transform sampling}.
To draw from a distribution $f$ with CDF $F$,
we sample $u$ from $Unif[0,1)$ and return $F^{-1}(u)$. \newline

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback = {green}, title = {Known Privacy Issues}, colbacktitle = black]
	Carrying out the inverse probability transform employs floating-point arithmetic,
	so we run into the same problems as were described in the uniform sampling section.
	This is potentially a very significant problem, and one for which we do not
	currently have a good solution.
\end{tcolorbox}
Because of the vulnerabilities inherent in using floating-point arithmetic, we would
like to avoid using inverse transform sampling when possible. \newline 

As mentioned for the Uniform, wehave a method for generating Gaussian samples via MPFR that respects exact rounding. It is not 
currently being used in the library.

\subsection{Geometric Distribution}
The Geometric is one such case where we can generate a distribution without inverse transform sampling.
To generate a $Geom(p)$, we can use our $sample\_bit$ function to
repeatedly sample random bits where $\Pr(bit = 1) = p$. We then return the number of samples
it takes to get our first $1$. This method is not susceptible to attacks based on floating-point vulnerabilities,
as it operates only over the integers. \newline
