\section{The Exponential Mechanism}

Sometimes, the global sensitivity of a function is too great, so the Laplace mechanism will not produce meaningful results. The median is one such function. In many cases, the \textit{Exponential mechanism} is an alternate approach that gives reasonable utility.\footnote{This is not the \textit{only} advantage of the exponential mechanism. It is a way to compute differentially private queries on non-numeric data, unlike the Laplace mechanism it does not assume that the probability of outputting a response ought to be symmetric about the true response, etc.} Introduced in 2007 by McSherry and Talwar, the exponential mechanism posits that for a given database, users prefer some outputs over others. That those preferences may be encapsulated with a utility score, where a high utility score indicates a higher preference for that output. The exponential mechanism releases outputs with probability proportional (in the exponent) to the utility score and the sensitivity of the utility function. 

\begin{definition}  
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a space of databases and let $[m,M]$ be an arbitrary range. Let $u: \mathcal{X} \times [m,M] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a utility function, which maps pairs of databases and outputs to a utility score. Let $\Delta u$ be the sensitivity of $u$ with respect to the database argument. The exponential mechanism outputs $r \in [m,M]$ with probability proportional to $\exp\left(\frac{\varepsilon u(x,r)}{2 \Delta u}\right)$ \cite{mcsherry2007mechanism, dwork2014algorithmic}.\footnote{The original definition is from \cite{mcsherry2007mechanism}, but here we state the version rewritten in \cite{dwork2014algorithmic} as it is slightly clearer.}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
The exponential mechanism preserves $(\varepsilon,0)$-differential privacy \cite{mcsherry2007mechanism, dwork2014algorithmic}.\footnote{As written in \cite{mcsherry2007mechanism}, the mechanism actually preserves $(2\varepsilon\Delta u,0)$-differential privacy; the main difference in the $\cite{dwork2014algorithmic}$ version is that it has the extra factor of $2\Delta u$ to avoid these extra terms.}
\end{theorem}

Note that the exponential mechanism may not be tractable in many cases, as it assumes the existence of a utility function, and even if one exists it may not be tractable to compute it efficiently. 

\section{An Exponential Mechanism for a quantile}

\subsection{Defining a sensible utility function}

Note that a user will prefer an output that is closer to the true quantile over one that is further away. Let $x$ be an (ordered) data set, let $r$ be a possible output, and let $N$ be the size of the data set. Let $\#(Z>r)$ refer to the number of points in $x$ above $r$. Then, the following is a reasonable utility function for a release $r$ for the $\alpha$-quantile of $x$.

\begin{equation}
u(x,r) = \max(\alpha, (1-\alpha))N - \vert (1-\alpha)\#(Z<r) - \alpha\#(Z>r)\vert.
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Sensitivity of the utility function}

\subsubsection{Neighboring Definition: Change One}
\begin{lemma}
The above utility function $u$ has $\ell_11$ sensitivity bounded above by 1 in the change one model.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $c_1 = \#(Z<r)$ and $c_2 = \#(Z>r)$. In one worst case, $c_1$ increases by 1 and $c_2$ decreases by 1.
Then, 
\begin{align*}
\Delta u &= \vert (1-\alpha) (c_1 + 1) - \alpha (c_2-1) \vert - \vert (1-\alpha) c_1 - \alpha c_2 \vert  \\
 &\le \vert (1-\alpha) (c_1 + 1) - \alpha (c_2-1) - (1-\alpha) c_1 + \alpha c_2 \vert\\
 & \le \vert c_1 + 1 - \alpha c_1 - \alpha - \alpha c_2 + \alpha - c_1 + \alpha c_1 + \alpha c_2 \vert\\
&= 1
\end{align*}
If instead $c_2$ decreases by 1 and $c_1$ increases by 1, the same thing will happen except with a negative sign that will not impact the final result due to the absolute values.
\end{proof}
\subsubsection{Neighboring Definition: Add/Drop One}

\begin{lemma}
The above utility function $u$ has $\ell_11$ sensitivity bounded above by $\max(1-\alpha, \alpha)$ in the add/drop one model.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $c_1 = \#(Z<r)$ and $c_2 = \#(Z>r)$.  Consider what happens if one point is added. There are two cases that would impact the utility function: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $c_1$ increases by one and nothing happens to $c_2$.
\item $c_2$ increases by one and nothing happens to $c_1$.
\end{enumerate}

Say the first case occurs. Then,

\begin{align*}
\Delta u &= | (1-\alpha) (c_1 + 1) - \alpha (c_2) | - | (1-\alpha) c_1 - \alpha c_2 |  \\
 	&\le | (1-\alpha) (c_1 + 1) - \alpha (c_2) - (1-\alpha) c_1 + \alpha c_2 | \\
	&= 1 - \alpha
\end{align*}

In the second case,

\begin{align*}
\delta u &= \vert (1-\alpha) (c_1) - \alpha (c_2 + 1) \vert - \vert (1-\alpha) c_1 - \alpha c_2 \vert \\
	&\le \vert c_1 -\alpha c_1 - \alpha c_2 - \alpha - c_1 + \alpha c_1 + \alpha c_2  \vert\\
	&= \alpha 
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

Subtracting a point leads to the same results.
